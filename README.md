# Title

## Introduction

Key Topics To Include for Each Project

## Summary

### Motivation
The general details of the machine learning project should be included in the
first part of your post. This will help potential employers understand what
you’re trying to achieve and why it’s important.

### Datasets

### Tools and Methods Used
You should include a short list of tools you used for this project and any
methods or processes you followed. This gives readers a better idea of how you
built your project and why you chose those particular tools.

## Running Code


### Installation

This project was created using poetry. To install the dependencies, run the
following command:

```bash
poetry env use 3.10
poetry install
```

I have also included a setup.py file for those who prefer to use pip. To install
the dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Docker

To build the docker image, run the following command:

```bash
docker build -t <image-name> .
```


## Results
Highlight the results you got from your model or system and why you think this
happened. Were there any outliers or anomalies in your data that affected the
results? Can you explain why these occurred, even if they weren’t expected?

## Takeaways
Finally, you’ll want to leave the readers with some takeaways. Did anything
surprising happen during this process that changed how you think about machine
learning at large? Did any personal growth occur as a result of working on
this project?
